# Yandex's Algorithms Crash Course

This repository contains problems and solutions for the Yandex's Algorithms crash course, divided by days and homework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

|-- Day1
| |-- ac_problem
| | |-- problem.md
| | |-- main.py
| |-- triangle_problem
| | |-- problem.md
| | |-- solution.py
| |-- phone_numbers_search_problem
| | |-- problem.md
| | |-- solution.py


Each day directory (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.) contains directories for each problem discussed during the day. Each problem directory contains a markdown file (`problem.md`) with the problem statement and a Python file (`solution.py` or `main.py`) containing the solution.

Feel free to adjust the structure or add more details according to your preferences. Let me know if you need further assistance!
