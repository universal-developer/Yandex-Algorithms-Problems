# Yandex's Algorithms Crash Course

This repository contains problems and solutions for the Yandex's Algorithms crash course, divided by days and homework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


```bash
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── v1.0
    └── day_1
        ├── ac_problem
        │   ├── main.py
        │   └── problem.md
        ├── phone_numbers_search_problem
        │   ├── problem.md
        │   └── solution.py
        └── triangle_problem
            ├── problem.md
            └── solution.py

5 directories, 8 files

```

Each day directory (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.) contains directories for each problem discussed during the day. Each problem directory contains a markdown file (`problem.md`) with the problem statement and a Python file (`solution.py` or `main.py`) containing the solution.

Feel free to adjust the structure or add more details according to your preferences. Let me know if you need further assistance!
